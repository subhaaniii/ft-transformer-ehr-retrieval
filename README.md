# FT-Transformer EHR Retrieval

A controlled method-study comparing an FT-Transformer-style tabular encoder with a baseline MLP encoder for multimodal retrieval.

The project is inspired by multimodal medical representation learning, but the public version uses controlled synthetic data instead of restricted clinical data. The goal is to study method behavior under known data-generating conditions, not to make clinical claims.

## Research Question

Can an FT-Transformer-style tabular encoder improve retrieval alignment compared with a simpler MLP encoder when the data contains feature interactions, noisy pairings, or larger sample sizes?

## What This Repository Shows

This repository demonstrates:

- how to build a two-tower contrastive retrieval pipeline
- how to compare MLP and FT-Transformer tabular encoders
- how Recall@K and lift-over-random can be used for retrieval evaluation
- how model behavior changes under linear, interaction-based, and noisy-pair synthetic setups
- why higher embedding similarity does not always guarantee better top-k retrieval

## Methods Compared

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| MLP EHR Encoder | A baseline feed-forward encoder for transformed tabular features |
| FT-Transformer EHR Encoder | A feature-tokenizer + Transformer encoder that applies self-attention over tabular feature tokens |

Both methods use the same symmetric InfoNCE contrastive loss and retrieval evaluation pipeline.

## Dataset Setup

The public repository uses controlled synthetic multimodal data.

Three dataset modes are included:

| Setup | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Linear | Tests whether a simple MLP is already sufficient when the signal is mostly linear |
| Interaction | Tests whether FT-Transformer helps when feature interactions matter |
| Noisy | Tests robustness when a fraction of image-EHR pairings are intentionally corrupted |

The generated images are controlled synthetic visual patterns rather than clinical medical images. This makes the benchmark reproducible, privacy-safe, and suitable for method-behavior analysis.

## Experiments

The final benchmark compares:

- encoder type: MLP vs FT-Transformer
- dataset mode: linear, interaction, noisy
- sample size: 500 pilot, 1000, 2000
- training duration: 10 epochs for the main benchmark

Metrics reported:

- Recall@1
- Recall@5
- Recall@10
- Recall@50
- lift over random baseline
- positive-pair cosine similarity
- training loss

## Key Findings

FT-Transformer did not universally outperform the MLP. Its behavior depended on the data setup.

Main observations:

- In linear settings, the MLP was already highly competitive.
- In the 1000-sample interaction setup, FT-Transformer improved retrieval over MLP.
- In noisy-pair settings, both models degraded, showing that better architecture cannot fully compensate for weak pair quality.
- FT-Transformer often improved positive-pair similarity, but higher similarity did not always translate into better top-k retrieval.

The main lesson is that architecture, data structure, sample size, and pairing quality must be evaluated together.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Generate synthetic data:

```powershell
python src/make_demo_data.py --mode interaction --n-samples 1000
```

Train the MLP baseline:

```powershell
python src/train.py --ehr-encoder mlp --epochs 10 --batch-size 32 --num-workers 0 --output-dir outputs/example_mlp --checkpoint-dir checkpoints/example_mlp
```

Train the FT-Transformer model:

```powershell
python src/train.py --ehr-encoder ftt --epochs 10 --batch-size 32 --num-workers 0 --output-dir outputs/example_ftt --checkpoint-dir checkpoints/example_ftt
```

## Limitations

This repository is a controlled method-analysis project rather than a clinical deployment study. The benchmark uses synthetic multimodal data so that the data structure, pairing quality, feature interactions, and sample-size effects can be studied under known conditions.

The visual inputs are controlled synthetic patterns rather than clinical medical images. Therefore, the results should be interpreted as evidence of experimental design, retrieval-evaluation reasoning, and model-behavior analysis, not as clinical performance or diagnostic capability.

A stronger follow-up would include repeated random seeds, longer training, additional sample-size sweeps, and evaluation on authorized real-world datasets under proper data-use restrictions.
